# Monitoring & Observability

## Overview
Comprehensive monitoring strategy across all system components. See [Monitoring Architecture](../diagrams/monitoring-system.mmd) for complete structure.

## System Health

### Core Metrics
Response times:
- API endpoints
- Database queries
- Cache operations
- External services

Resource utilization:
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Disk usage
- Network traffic

Queue performance:
- Job processing rates
- Queue lengths
- Processing times
- Error rates

### Integration Health
Shopify integration:
- API response times
- Webhook delivery
- Order processing
- Product sync status

Authentication service:
- Auth response times
- Session management
- Token validation
- Error rates

Email service:
- Delivery rates
- Bounce rates
- Processing times
- Queue status

## Business Metrics

### Event Performance
Real-time tracking:
- Active shoppers
- Transaction volume
- Sales totals
- Category performance

Inventory metrics:
- Items listed
- Items sold
- Return rates
- Stock levels

### User Engagement
Consignor activity:
- Registration rates
- Inventory creation
- Volunteer signups
- Drop-off scheduling

System usage:
- Active users
- Session duration
- Feature usage
- Error encounters

## Error Tracking

### Error Categories
System errors:
- Application crashes
- Database errors
- Cache failures
- Queue problems

Integration errors:
- API failures
- Webhook misses
- Sync failures
- Timeout issues

Business logic errors:
- Validation failures
- Process violations
- State conflicts
- Data inconsistencies

### Error Response
Automatic recovery:
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback options
- Self-healing processes
- State recovery

Manual intervention:
- Alert generation
- Error documentation
- Recovery procedures
- Resolution tracking

## Alerting Strategy

### Priority Levels
P0 - Critical:
- System downtime
- Data loss risk
- Security breach
- Integration failure

P1 - High:
- Performance degradation
- Process failures
- Data inconsistency
- Integration delays

P2 - Medium:
- Minor disruptions
- Slow responses
- Warning conditions
- Non-critical errors

P3 - Low:
- Edge cases
- Performance warnings
- Resource warnings
- Minor issues

### Alert Routing
Distribution rules:
- Technical team
- Support staff
- Client admins
- System admins

Escalation paths:
- Initial response
- Secondary contact
- Management escalation
- Emergency contacts

## Performance Monitoring

### Response Times
Tracking points:
- API endpoints
- Database queries
- Cache operations
- External calls

Thresholds:
