# Security Architecture

## Overview
Comprehensive security implementation across all system layers. See [Security Architecture](../diagrams/security-layers.mmd) for complete security structure.

## Authentication

### Clerk.dev Integration
- User registration/login
- Email verification
- Password management
- Session handling
See [Auth Flow](../diagrams/auth-flow.mmd) for details.

### Token Management
- JWT validation
- Token refresh
- Session timeout
- Device tracking

### Multi-factor Authentication
- Email verification required
- Optional 2FA for admins
- Device fingerprinting
- Login monitoring

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control
Admin roles:
- Super admin (system-wide)
- Client admin (per client)
- Event admin (per event)
- Support staff

Consignor roles:
- Regular consignor
- Super consignor
- Volunteer

### Permission Management
Resource permissions:
- Read access
- Write access
- Delete access
- Administrative actions

### Multi-tenant Security
- Client isolation
- Resource ownership
- Cross-tenant protection
- Access validation

## Data Protection

### Client Isolation
- Domain-based separation
- Data partitioning
- Cache isolation
- Resource protection

### Sensitive Data
- Password security (via Clerk.dev)
- API key encryption
- Personal data protection
- Payment information handling

### Data Transmission
- TLS encryption
- Secure webhooks
- API security
- File transfer protection

## API Security

### Request Validation
- Input sanitization
- Parameter validation
- Type checking
- Size limits

### Rate Limiting
- Per-client limits
- Per-endpoint limits
- Burst allowance
- Rate monitoring

### Webhook Security
- Signature verification
- Replay protection
- IP whitelisting
- Timeout handling

## Monitoring & Auditing

### Security Monitoring
- Authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious activity

### Audit Logging
Events tracked:
- Authentication events
- Administrative actions
- Data modifications
- Access attempts

### Alert System
Triggers:
- Security violations
- Multiple failures
- Unusual activity
- System attacks

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Real-time monitoring
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Alert generation

### Response Procedures
- Incident classification
- Response protocols
- Communication plan
- Recovery procedures

### Recovery Process
- Account recovery
- Data restoration
- Access restoration
- Incident documentation

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- Personal data handling
- Data retention
- Data deletion
- Privacy notices

### Security Standards
- Password requirements
- Session management
- Access control
- Data protection

### Audit Requirements
- Activity logging
- Change tracking
- Access records
- Compliance reporting
