# Durable Objects Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for using Cloudflare Durable Objects to handle critical operations requiring strong consistency and atomic transactions in our consignment sale system.

## Core Durable Objects

### 1. Sale Session DO
- **Purpose**: Manages active sale sessions with strong consistency
- **Lifecycle**: 1-10 days duration
- **Key Features**:
  - Atomic transaction handling
  - Real-time inventory status tracking
  - Commission calculation during sales
  - Prevention of item modifications during active sales
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Active state maintained in DO
  - Completed sessions persisted to D1
- **Consistency Requirements**:
  - Strict ordering of sales operations
  - Atomic updates for inventory status
  - Real-time commission calculations

### 2. Inventory Reconciliation DO
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistency between local inventory and Shopify
- **Sync Strategy**: 
  - Recommended: 5-minute batch processing intervals
  - Rationale: Balances real-time accuracy with system load
- **Key Features**:
  - Item state management
  - Conflict resolution (most recent change wins)
  - Complete data point tracking
  - Locking mechanism for items during active sales
- **State Transitions**:
  - Locked: During active sales
  - Modifiable: When unsold and eligible for transfer
  - Transfer state: When moving between events

### 3. Commission Calculation DO
- **Purpose**: Handles real-time commission calculations and adjustments
- **Key Features**:
  - Fixed rates per event
  - Real-time calculations during sales
  - Integration with volunteer bonus system
  - Per-sale processing via Shopify webhooks
- **Error Handling**:
  - Retry mechanism for failed calculations
  - User-facing error display
  - Persistent retry capability

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Flow
1. Sale Initiation:
   - Sale Session DO created
   - Items locked for modification
   - Real-time commission tracking begins

2. During Sale:
   - Inventory updates atomic within Sale Session DO
   - Commission calculations processed in real-time
   - Shopify sync handled by Inventory Reconciliation DO

3. Post-Sale:
   - Session data persisted to D1
   - Commission data finalized
   - Items either marked as sold or transferred

### Integration Points
1. Shopify Integration:
   - Webhook handling for sales
   - Inventory sync every 5 minutes
   - Conflict resolution favoring recent changes

2. Existing Systems:
   - D1 Database for persistent storage
   - Workers KV for configuration
   - Queue system for background tasks

### Security and Performance
1. Access Control:
   - DO-specific access patterns
   - Role-based operation permissions
   - Tenant isolation requirements

2. Performance Considerations:
   - DO placement strategy
   - Data locality optimization
   - Connection pooling for D1 persistence

### Migration Strategy
1. Data Migration:
   - Phased migration from existing storage
   - Validation of consistency
   - Rollback procedures

2. Operational Migration:
   - Feature flag controlled rollout
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Performance baseline establishment

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Sale Session Failures
- Automatic retry mechanism
- User notification system
- Data consistency verification
- Recovery procedures

### Inventory Reconciliation Issues
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Data repair mechanisms
- Sync failure handling

### Commission Calculation Errors
- Persistent retry capability
- Error logging and tracking
- Manual intervention procedures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- DO availability monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Data consistency validation

### Maintenance Procedures
- Backup strategies
- Clean-up procedures
- Version upgrade process
- Performance optimization

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- DO instance management
- Data partitioning strategies
- Performance optimization opportunities

### Feature Expansion
- Additional DO types
- Enhanced consistency guarantees
- Extended monitoring capabilities
