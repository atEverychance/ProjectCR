# Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing approach covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios for our Cloudflare-first architecture. See [Testing Architecture](/docs/diagrams/architecture/testing-architecture.mmd) for complete structure.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Core business logic:
- Commission calculations
- Inventory management
- Schedule validation
- Payment processing
See [Unit Test Coverage](../diagrams/architecture/unit-test-coverage.mmd) for details.

### Integration Tests
Service integration:
- Worker endpoints
- Shopify integration
- Email processing
- Authentication flow
- KV operations
- D1 database operations

### End-to-End Tests
Critical paths:
- Consignor registration
- Inventory creation
- Sales processing
- Event reconciliation
- Payment flows
